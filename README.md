# 🥋 Codewars Practice

This repository contains my personal solutions to coding challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).  
It is organized by **kata difficulty levels (kyu)**, ranging from beginner-friendly `8 kyu` to advanced `4 kyu`.  

The goal of this project is to:
- Track my progress in problem-solving and algorithms.
- Build a collection of reference solutions.
- Improve my Python skills step by step.

## 📖 About Codewars
- Codewars uses the kyu/dan system (from martial arts 🥋):
- 8 kyu → easiest
- 1 kyu → expert/master
- Each kata is a small coding challenge that improves problem-solving skills.
